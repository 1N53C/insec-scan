## About Insec Scan
Insec Scan is a Python Script that allows you to simplify enumeration of
Websites.

It automates the use of three wellknown pentesting tools:
1. nmap
2. dirb
3. nikto

Insec Scan guides you through the process of scanning and saves your output to a folder that 
will be created for you if you like.
